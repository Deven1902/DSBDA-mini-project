Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System! This project utilizes content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their plot summaries. By analyzing the similarity between movies, the system suggests relevant and personalized recommendations for users.

## Dataset

The movie recommendation system is built using the popular MovieLens dataset. The dataset includes a vast collection of movies with detailed information such as title, genre, and plot summaries. It provides a rich source of data for training and evaluating the recommendation algorithm.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install the required dependencies:


## Usage

1. Run the recommendation system:

2. Enter the title of a movie when prompted.

3. Sit back and let the system generate a curated list of similar movies for you!

## Results

The movie recommendation system leverages advanced algorithms and natural language processing techniques to deliver accurate and high-quality movie recommendations. By analyzing the plot summaries and identifying patterns, the system ensures that users receive personalized recommendations tailored to their preferences.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate user feedback and ratings to improve the recommendation accuracy.
- Develop a visually appealing web interface using popular frameworks like Streamlit or Flask.
- Implement collaborative filtering algorithms to enhance the recommendation system's capabilities.
- Expand the dataset to include a wider range of movies and genres.
